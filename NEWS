This file describes changes in recent versions of jobcomp/elasticsearch.

* Changes in jobcomp/elasticsearch v0.7
=======================================
-- Plugin merged in SLURM master branch. Different installation process
depending if the SLURM version is prior to 15.08 or not. Please, refer
to the INSTALL.md file for installation instructions.
-- Added error_cnt variable to launch an error every 100 jobs that failed
to be inserted into ElasticSearch server

* Changes in jobcomp/elasticsearch v0.6
=======================================
-- Add spec file for RPM generation for slurm version 14.11.6
-- Minor problems and enhancements by Moe Jette to jobcomp_elasticsearch.c:
 -- There were some missing header files includes
 -- derived_exitcode needs to be printed as %lu rather than %hu.
 -- the fsize variable was set and never read
 -- I added some "static" definitions on functions
 -- Some compilers report warnings for variables definitions NOT at the start 
of a block (I needed to use xmalloc for the pop_marks variable)
 -- Some compilers report warnings for the xrealloc return value not used
 -- In the log functions you are testing for empty strings, so testing if the 
first character is '\0' is faster than using strlen()
 -- The xstrfmtcat is faster than using a temporary value and copying data
 -- slurmdb_association_rec_t was changed to slurmdb_assoc_rec_t
